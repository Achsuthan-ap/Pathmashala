                        Pathmashala claims to be the first authentic Yoga Studio in the Jaffna Peninsula, catering for enthusiasts keen to learn the art of Yoga in its purest form. Often the essence of yoga as a way of life is forgotten and greater emphasis is given to the physical benefits derived from the practice of Yoga.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While it is important to recognize the physical attributes of Yoga, the mental, emotional and spiritual attributes are overlooked. Pathmashala's approach to Yoga is holistic aimed at the total well-being of an individual.
